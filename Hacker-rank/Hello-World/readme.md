We're starting out by printing the most famous computing phrase of all time! In the editor below, use either [printf](http://www.cplusplus.com/printf) or [cout](http://www.cplusplus.com/cout) to print the string to [stdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_.28stdout.29).

The more popular command form is `cout`. It has the following basic form:

`cout<<value_to_print<<value_to_print;`

Any number of values can be printed using one command as shown.

The `printf` command comes from C language. It accepts an optional format specification and a list of variables. Two examples for printing a string are:

`printf("%s", string);` `printf(string);`

Note that neither method adds a newline. It only prints what you tell it to.
