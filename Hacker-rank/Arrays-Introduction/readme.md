An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.

For arrays of a known size, in this case, use the following declaration:

```
int arr[10]; //Declares an array named arr of size 10, i.e, you can 
store 10 integers.
```

**Note** Unlike C, C++ allows dynamic allocation of arrays at runtime without special calls like malloc(). If , `int arr[n]` will create an array with space for integers.

Accessing elements of an array:

```
Indexing in arrays starts from 0.So the first element is stored at 
arr[0],the second element at arr[1] and so on through arr[9].
```

You will be given an array of integers and you have to print the integers in the reverse order.
